          <h1 className="text-5xl py-6">What is cryptocurrency?</h1>
          <p>
            Cryptocurrency is digital money that doesn't require a bank or
            financial institution to verify transactions and can be used for
            purchases or as an investment. Transactions are then verified and
            recorded on a blockchain, an unchangeable ledger that tracks and
            records assets and trades
          </p>

          <h1 className="text-5xl py-6">What Is a Blockchain?</h1>
          <p>
            Blockchain is a distributed database or ledger shared among a
            computer network's nodes. They are best known for their crucial role
            in cryptocurrency systems for maintaining a secure and decentralized
            record of transactions, but they are not limited to cryptocurrency
            uses. Blockchains can be used to make data in any industry
            immutable—the term used to describe the inability to be altered.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Because there is no way to change a block, the only trust needed is
            at the point where a user or program enters data. This aspect
            reduces the need for trusted third parties, which are usually
            auditors or other humans that add costs and make mistakes.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Since Bitcoin's introduction in 2009, blockchain uses have exploded
            via the creation of various cryptocurrencies, decentralized finance
            (DeFi) applications, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and smart
            contracts.
